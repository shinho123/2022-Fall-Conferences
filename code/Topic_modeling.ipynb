Since cryptocurrency is a highly volatile market, hence there are daily ups and downs in the prices of various cryptocurrencies. Apart from this, there are many new cryptocurrencies being launched every now and then. Hence, to cover all the latest happenings in the cryptocurrency sector, a dynamic blockchain and cryptocurrency content writer is required. A cryptocurrency and bitcoin article writer must understand the basic technical terminologies of this sector to come up with good news articles. Also, the bitcoin and cryptocurrency writer must have some level of understanding of the cryptocurrency market. The cryptocurrency articles posted on one's site must be well researched and up to date. For a good quality cryptocurrency article, various aspects of a news story must be thoroughly understood before crafting the cryptocurrency content.  Further, it is necessary that the articles must be posted as soon as possible because the freshness factor in an article gets lost with time.  Posting fresh and unique articles regularly on a site is essential for getting more visitors.  Hence any cryptocurrency firm or company must hire crypto writers who can produce timely articles on cryptocurrency. Content marketing strategy plays a vital role in determining the future growth of a website. Hence, getting regularly updated content on a website becomes essential to get a steady flow of visitors to the website.

      "ABSTRACT SILVR360 is a cutting-edge, high-technology platform built on Ethereum blockchain with a focus on film and gaming production and virtual world distribution. Our mission is to provide high-tech entertainment service to millions of users, who can travel through the virtual world by computers or other devices to experience amazing visual effects in 2D, 3D, 4D or 360 degree. Our aim is to attract a larger volume of audiences and recruit or build rapport with a wide range of artists in the media industry globally. Silvrcoin is produced by the real utility, in the future users can use Silvrcoin to purchase the subscription and artists can earn the Silvrcoin if they are involved in each project. SILVR360 BUSINESS MODEL INTRODUCTION On our distribution platform, producers can find new ways to reach more audiences through our service. We aim to provide new development for the benefits of the existing fast-growing media & entertainment industry. This whitepaper outlines our strategies and presents how we will communicate with the users, rewards to the business developers about how to provide the best service. SILVR360 FILM DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS MODEL SILVR360 is a digital distribution platform and plan to provide the service for millions of users, that refers to optional high-tech films and TV shows such as 2d, 3d, and 360 degree VFX. We plan to operate a VOD streaming system delivered over the blockchain network. Digital film distribution is radically growing in the entertainment industry, which has changed and upgraded not only for the established release patterns, technology or operating system models but also changed user's expectations. Therefore, we aim to provide a service that when users select a video, they can immediately enjoy special visual effects on multiple devices with optional VFX equipment. Online entertainment platform is among the most promising business model and its innovation has changed the entire industry worldwide, attracting a greater audience to access a larger range of content. VOD may not only impact on Hollywood, Europe, Pacific and Asian markets, but also might affect the independent filmmakers in the future. High-tech digital VOD platform is a good opportunity for independent films by using online distribution; for those lower budget filmmakers, they can also find more audiences worldwide and there have been some good examples of filmmakers who were generating multi-billion incomes. We believe getting the right film distribution strategy is much more challenging and complex, especially the theatrical market has become very crowded and seasonal, the pressure on box office performance in the first few weeks is intense normally with higher operating costs such as printing, advertising, and promotion expenses. For many occasions, projects might skip a theatrical release if the film is better suited to digital release market. Film producers need to be better engaged in working with the chosen distribution partners, understanding and using the most effective medium. The VOD industry is still in the early stage with fewer competitors. In a whole picture, by priority we are scheduling more creative, high- technology mode development is to be preserved. So SILVR360's goal is to be the most prevalence digital platform by distributing to users with the cutting-edge equipment distribution to maximize users' visual effects as well. From there the users would upgrade and enjoy their entertainment lives with a new way of innovation. SILVR360 DIGITAL VIDEO GAME DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS MODEL One of our digital distribution is that we deliver the virtual service of video game content as digital information. The users are not purchasing the games, instead, they get the right to play the games for free and players can purchase downloadable content which is additional content created for a releasing video game in a physical package, which can be purchased by offering at low costs by using a type of micro-transaction system for payment. From the users point of view, digital access to content is now expanding globally, billions of players that everyone can drop onto the game's virtual world each day, battling to each other and spending money to customize their characters. By online platform, which makes control of territory releases difficulty. Our release platform of the developed video games can be played using Windows PC, Mac OS, and Linux operating systems. Also, mobile gaming digital distribution is another method of delivering content comprising iOS devices and Android phones that will allow more developers to create and distribute their games on our platforms so that users can play the game online anytime, anywhere. Other features that we are planning to include that players can chat and communicate via headset in-game. We plan to distribute from independent game makers to major developers so that we can become one of the largest digital distribution platforms with millions of users within a decade. CONCLUSION Therefore, fundamentally our digital distribution is changing the game, our online platform will build on a new generation of the internet, blockchain. On top of the blockchain that would become a powerful tool to any size of the media projects to distribute for maximizing profits that would not have been conceivable historically.\n",

The mission of Ad Fontes Media is “to make news consumers smarter and news media better.” Ad Fontes rates the news for reliability and bias to help people navigate the news landscape. Ad Fontes is Latin for “to the source,” because at the heart of what Ad Fontes Media does is look at the source—analyze the very content itself—to rate it. Ad Fontes has created a system of news content ratings that has beneficial applications for all stakeholders in a healthy news media landscape, including consumers, educators, journalism outlets, researchers, advertisers, and social media platforms. Ad Fontes currently creates ratings with a small team of human analysts who have political views from across the spectrum. The analysts are trained to look at the content of the news and score it according to a consistent methodology. Ad Fontes provides the news source ratings themselves as a reference product for consumers and educators—mainly through through its widely known Media Bias Chart. Ad Fontes also now offers a software platform for educators to teach students how to rate the news using its approach. Ad Fontes Media is incorporated as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) in Colorado. The stated public benefit of Ad Fontes Media is the same as its mission. It is currently funded by its founder, by a crowdfunding campaign which ran in late 2018,  by sales of licenses, prints, data products, and educational products, and by donations (non-tax-deductible) by individuals who believe in its mission.\n",

      "Professional Logo Design Agency A Professional logo design needs to be readable, versatile and memorable even before it leaves the drawing board. Or it’ll do no favours for a brand. Professional Logo design is about interpreting a brand through an iconic mark. It is a visual device that will serve as an instantly recognisable calling card for a business, and perhaps reflect the essence of the product or service in its make-up. But before anything is put to paper or pixel, it’s important to consider where it will appear and who in the world will see it. Only once a thorough understanding is reached can the creative process truly begin. As a leading Freelance logo design agency, we appreciate how important a professional logo is to the success of a brand, so we always do the right amount of consultation and research before we begin the professional logo design process. Because a professional logo design should define a brand, not prove how clever we are with fonts and felt tip pens. Want to talk Professional Logo Design?

One of the directors was working for past 5 years with that company and I joined in 2 years back. We were confident about our knowledge and the product that we can yield but that somehow never landed on the screens of our audience. The reason being a lot of manipulations and unavailability of creative freedom that every artist needs and deserve. We both aligned on the thought of creating a space for artists where art (in this case, filmmaking) should speak for itself, giving lesser preference to by products (profits). Thus this company landed in March 2018, with the sole motive to prioritse the creative freedom of everyone associate with us, be it the clients, our team, our vendors, or freelancers.

      "We created Neutron because you shouldn’t have to choose electronic accessories between what’s affordable and what works.  We’re people like you. We identify ourselves with brands we like and trust. The problem was we realized there was a lack of companies out there making innovative, reliable products for our favorite gadgets.  Driven by a passion for products with cohesive branding, timeless style, and quality craftsmanship, we created Neutron to be an alternative to the common, uninspired tech accessory brands. We showed a few friends what we made....they loved them and still use them every day.  Fast forward a few years and happy customers later, our products reflect our core values from day one: freedom, adventure, and style.  We continue to raise the bar for outfitting your favorite gadgets with accessories that make your life simple, better, and more connected. We add to the experience of listening to your favorite songs, connecting with family and friends, and going on your next adventure.  You can finally stop equipping your favorite gadgets with generic brand accessories you have to replace in a few months. Neutron is the first and last stop on your search for accessories that combine aesthetics with functionality.  It’s time to connect to the world around you with luxury, style, and convenience — the Neutron way.\n",

If you can’t find, you can’t buy. No universal taxonomy exists to describe fashion. Shoppers do not know the right words to search for what they like. Fashion is visual, but the search is not. Meanwhile, because you can’t filter products by how much you like them, you’ll have to browse thousands of products – many of which you’ll dislike. When shopping feels tedious, the shopper quits.

This is app belongs to a category of apps called “Reward Apps” , which is an app that rewards its users with valuable items such as coupons , discounts, cash to spend on a famous website, prizrs or even cash money. We loved the idea to share advertising revenue with our users in a way that we get money to develop our app, the user gets a reward for doing tasks and watching ads, and advertisers get traffic to their product.  We thought to our selfs that the best way to accomplish this task would be to use cryptocurrency to reward our users, but we wanted to reward our users instantly and without fees overhead unlike many other similar reward apps, so we decided to work with “Bitcoin” cryptocurrency coin The main goal for us was to give our users a taste of the cryptocurrency world, our app is not intended to make you rich or quit your job or any of this spam bullshit, it is really just to give you a “sweet taste” of the crypto currency world for these who wants to hold some coins but don't want to go through the hussle of investing money or going through dodgy exchanges.

      "Idea: People get frustrated by never-ending browsing and non-stop advertisements on websites. Time for companies to create their company branches in Metaverse. People can work and shop in Metaverse by incarnate themselves in the Metaverse city and do similar things as in the real world. E-commercial laws and reality legislation are used to protect us.  What we do: create a Metaverse city for business based on cloud computing, VR, and block-chain technologies. Any type of company in the world can create their own company branch in the metaverse city for business. The company business ID in the metaverse will be connected to the company business ID in the real world. The employee incarnations in metaverse will also connect to real world social security number and bank account. The reality laws and regulations are valid to protect employees working in the Metaverse, as well as shopping and other business activities. All the business activities are recorded and protected by block-chain technology, reality laws, legislation. Market: the customer in the market is unlimited. Any company in the world is a potential customer because any company can create a branch in the Metaverse city for business.  For example, telecommunication companies, like Nokia, Google, Facebook, they can let employee working in a branch in Metaverse by using VR. As well as the companies open shops in Metaverse city, all the customers can visit this branch by VR and try the product before buying it.  Other companies, such as exhibitions and auctions, can open the gallery in Metaverse city, people can visit this gallery by using VR and buy art. For sure, the real arts will be delivered to their home in reality after that. There will be other business activities in the real world that can be introduced into Metaverse city, like banking, stock market, etc. We can extend the supported business step by step in the future. We can see a long-term development of Metaverse cities. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sdjgTuIQU4Q6cj1gMvR0zxfBPPjLnb1x/view?usp=sharing\n",

      "Business Name Chooser is a free iOS and Android app that helps you check a business name with ASIC, IP Australia, domain and social media simultaneously. When you are starting a business there are many vital activities that you have to do. Choosing the name for your business often sets the tone, form and brand for your new venture, and it’s hard to think of a logo or website look and feel before you have the name set. You don’t want to tell friends and colleagues before you have a name either - firstly, it’s hard to explain without a handle and secondly you don’t want anyone borrowing your idea! Business Name Chooser is a FREE app that helps you rapidly test various business names. Normally when you set up a business you need to check that the name is available in the business name databases for Government registration, and company incorporation with ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission), that it does not match an existing trademark already provided to another business by IP Australia, and that there is a suitable domain name available. This app takes all the hard work out of that by simultaneously checking these different databases and then confirming if the name is acceptable. If the name does clash with any existing names can will be able to choose a new name or try out some suggestions from the App. As an Adviser to numerous startups, Brent Jackson says: I am often amazed how far people go with the development of a complete product offering before ensuring they can secure their name - it’s a costly mistake.\n",

Equinox enables marketing agencies, educational and entertainment companies to finally realise the potential of location-based augmented reality (AR) and publish AR content on a global platform. Our mission is to become the default platform for augmented reality experience, enabling companies and individuals to focus on the content.  Instead of building single-purpose AR apps, deploy AR content on Equinox! In this way, you don't need to acquire users from scratch and educate them about AR.  We monetise the platform by licensing the tools and by offering freemium content.  Our immediate prospects for doing business include marketing agencies, retail chains, publishers, music festivals and tourist boards. Marketing agencies have a pain to seek new ways to acquire users (eyeballs) for their messages. Retailers have a pain to increase engagement with their customers, as well as their loyalty. Publishers need to present new ways to attract advertisers with dynamic content. Music festivals need to navigate people across large venues. Tourist boards need to keep people walking in certain areas. We take care of that.\n",

The INK Games Platform is creating the future of how players participate in the leisure economy by allowing them, for the first time ever, to track and monetize their global connectivity and viral reach – in perpetuity.   The INK Platform allows creators, influencers, players, in fact anyone with a smartphone, to earn revenue and get paid for their following, right from their phone.  For influencers, this means no more one-time payments from brands, no more turning one’s entire following over to brands through one-off campaigns.  It’s our vision to connect the world through INK IDs (user handles), and pay all users on the revenues that flow through their global connectivity, day-in and day-out…perpetually. Core to the INK Platform is the Company’s proprietary payment and tracking engine, which dynamically maps each user’s global viral audience, algorithmically converts platform engagement into an Impact Score, then pays users perpetually on their score.  This is a big moment for the gaming industry.  This proprietary technology is sorely needed as we transition into a new era of community economics in gaming. An award-winning group of gaming visionaries and development experts from EA, Zynga, SciPlay, and Buffalo Studios, the INK Games team has a track record of scaling mass-market franchises and achieving exceptional outcomes for investors and shareholders.

      "PITCH MomSays connects moms together by interest and location so they get the products they need. Moms are overwhelmed with the sheer volume of products out there. Therefore, moms find it easier to get what they need through recommendations. Our platform allows brands to market and sell to moms through recommendations of other moms. This is a $2 trillion industry in the U.S.A alone and we currently have 40,000 users per month with 100,000 visitors a month. We work with an average of 5 brands a month and we are post-revenue. PROBLEM|OPPORTUNITY Current Challenge: Moms are overwhelmed with the sheer volume of products available to them so they rely on trusted recommendations to buy their products. The companies, on the other hand, spend a lot of time and effort trying to capture the attention of the busy mom. SOLUTION|PRODUCT  A platform that connects moms to their products through storytelling. Our unique way of selling speaks from a viewpoint of moms for moms without having to advertise. Therefore, the content the moms choose to read will seamlessly provide matching products so they can buy it on the platform. BUSINESS MODEL The moms around the world access the marketplace for free and the brands pay to market and sell to their desired audience (based on location and interests). Brands select campaigns to market their products to boost recommendations and pay a monthly fee to manage their inventory. COMPETITORS and DIFFERENTIATION Competitors include other mom networks like smilemom.com, content providers like babble.com as well as generic event apps. Our differentiation is we market through storytelling written by moms and connect brands through campaigns and events all in one. TECHNOLOGY and SCALABILITY The technology is the web platform that connects with moms around the world with a smartphone. This enables us to provide user-centric content desired by the audience based on their interests and location. This also allows multiple campaigns and localized sales to be run concurrently for the desired location. The site currently has a reach in 6 countries and can reach out worldwide to tap a market that is worth $1 trillion. EXECUTION PLAN|GO TO MARKET STRATEGY We are currently live and operating post-revenue and our strategy is to make this a platform available to any brand that needs to sell to moms around the world based on interest and location. We want to build a community-driven marketplace for moms that leverages the existing readers and allow vendors to manage their own inventory of products and target their desired audience by interest and location. Our platform would ultimately combine the power of moms' reviews with e-commerce that will facilitate the type of products and services that moms get to buy based on recommendations.\n",

As in any conventional social network or creative portfolios directory, in Creary users can post their work to share them with the rest of the community. As an innovative fact, in Creary, users will receive rewards for the interactions their content receives. The likes are not just likes anymore, so users should bet on the quality of what is published to get a good community of followers who vote for their works.    Creary offers a public and transparent alternative to intellectual property. The platform applies the power of attorney of the revolutionary Blockchain technology in the process of registering content to create incorruptible proof of existence (POE) that certify the authorship of any digital work.    Money is always a political issue. This is why we have designed an alternative cryptocurrency with the goal of promoting the economic empowerment of creative people against the traditional banking system. Get your first CREA sharing quality works on the platform. Receive donations every time you receive a “like” from other users.\n",

We call it Personalization as a Service. When stores sign up, we set them up with sensors and beacons, which trigger personal product recommendations as customers walk through the store. Even when customers pick up an item off the shelf, they seamlessly receive more details about the product on their own Spaces app.  Now retailers are able to understand which store sections their customers are spending the most time in, which brands shoppers are picking up the most, and much more in-store analytics that they can only get on their e-commerce websites.\n",

Feezital is a registered trademark of Feelkaro Online Media Private Limited and we are DIPP Recognized startup in the Startup India Program. Why Feezital – Our Story While the world is getting highly addicted to online eCommerce, with big players cashing on the moolah in exchange for discounts, time and convenience, there is also another side to this glittering story. It is of dissatisfaction (on product quality), Economic inequality (Only a few large companies rule the market to monopolize profits.) and regret (for being lured to big discounts on inflated prices). Feezital.com is a location-based shopping portal for the convenience of online shopping. It is born to break-free from the illusion of ‘convenient’ online shopping with the larger goal to support the local stores and contribute to the local economy. Consumers can now browse online for their required products, and buy online or offline directly from the nearby stores at their own convenience. Feezital is here to reinstate your local shopping experience. You can get superior service, high-quality products, widest variety, best discounts and direct deals with a better online shopping experience than all other large eCommerce companies – also, with the ‘human’ advantage of first directly talk to the seller then buy.\n",

      "We help our clients build strong inbound links to their websites that consistently provide long-term ranking value. Through custom linking strategies, we help deliver those needed links that create high rankings and traffic growth. Our link building methods pay special attention to ever-changing search engine guidelines, and we only use white hat link building strategies. Google and other search engines have built quite a unique search algorithm technology over the years. One of the most significant parts of this technology is built around determining the types of inbound links pointing to your website. This includes whether or not the sites that link to your website are valuable or trusted. Google, for example, measures that trust and determines whether or not you have enough top quality or authoritative sites linking to your website. Google also looks at your linking \"neighbourhoods\" and then algorithmically assigns trust, strength, and recognition for your website. We've been building links through content creation and outreach for small and large businesses for over 20 years. We only use white hat link building methods such as content development, guest posting, interviews, email marketing, and other popular link building techniques that get your website and brand noticed.\n",

Users can employ advanced filtering options to search and browse thousands of Black e-commerce brands on our site, and brands can reach their target audiences with greater ease. The problem Nile solves is two-sided. For conscientious consumers, there is a growing demand to support Black-owned businesses in all aspects, particularly when shopping online. Yet, information about Black brands is disjointed and siloed. Plainly speaking, it’s harder to buy Black than it is to buy from Amazon, so where do consumers end up shopping online? Amazon.  For Black ecommerce brands, the problem is even more pressing. Amongst the vast retail noise on the internet, they can’t find their target customers. Our platform aggregates information about Black brands to make it easy for consumers to find them, and to make it easy for brands to market to interested buyers. Without Nile, users spend more time searching for Black brands on search engines or directories that are focused on local businesses and services, and businesses have a harder time reaching a prime (inter)national audience for their products.\n",
